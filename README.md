Genghis, another Khan
=====================
Hi!
Welcome to this humble project that tries to make a tool so that non-programmers can make Khan Academy styled exercises.

####Lovely, what exactly is this about?

Khan academy offers in their github account their [exercise module], which, if you make a specific XML file using their tags and rules, will turn it into a wonderful, self correcting exercise with many possibilities both for students and teachers.

This tools aim to make this more accessible for other people with less tech-oriented skills. With the tool you will be able to create all the statements and math using a simple WYIWYG editor.

####Who made this?

The coding belongs to [@juanlu], while the managing and organization was taken care of by [@pedmume],without whom this project could have not been possible at all.

This project was created by the gradient group, which is part of the Telematics Engineering department of University Carlos III of Madrid

####Ok, the code works but, well, it's a little messy!

Yes I know and yes, I apologize. Unfortunately I didn't have as much time as I wanted to for cleaning code and improving performance, however after exams I plan on redoing the tool using the framework [Laravel].

####Awesome, can I install it from here?

Unfortunately, no can do. Not yet at least.

The problem is that some of this code depends on an API that I can't upload because it's not mine, so unfortunately this won't work if you try to install it.

Once I redo the entire code in Laravel, I'll make it as modular as possible so that it can be installed anywhere!
